Project Spec Feedback
=====================

### Product Backlog (10/10)
+ The product backlog should be various pieces that need to be implemented
    rather than high level description of pages/features.
    - Similar to your Sprint 1 backlog tasks. Basically, the sprint backlogs
        should be pieces of the product backlog

### Data Models (10/10)
+ Looks good, well thought out.
+ I may suggest to replace the `Repository` model with data retrieved directly
    using the GitHub API, to avoid having to synchronize the model for each
    repository with the actual GitHub data frequently.

### Wireframes or Mock-ups (10/10)

### Sprint 1 Planning (9.9/10)
+ Does not specify who the lead is for the Sprint.

+ Very reasonable goals to accomplish in the first sprint. If your team can
    finish these, you guys will be in a good position.
