### Bailey
I like your project idea, there are a lot of interesting technical challenges involved. As a three person team, you guys should aim to meet all of the proposed goals. For your algorithm of giving people appropriate code segments, it would also be intereresting if you relied on crowd sourcing. For example, you could have a base difficulty index based on your proposed algorithm. Each user would have a self designated experience level on a scale you provide, and when given code segments, they could mark code segments as being too difficult or easy. "Troll" users could be identified by voting too out of line could be ignored in this approach. I would recommend using only the GitHub API for getting code, and making the application very good, rather than pulling from multiple sources and having the quality suffer due to an overly generic design.

### Eliot
This looks like a interesting project which is an appropriate size for a team of three. I think coming up with a reliable algorithm to determine the difficulty of a code sample will be pretty challenging on its own. I'm kind of confused as to how the code collection is on the site, will it be all user contributions or is it something you fetch everytime a user makes a search. Sometimes, especially for someone trying to learn something new, it can be difficult to know what to search for. Another feature which might be nice to have is simply displaying the top projects for certain categories (like difficult, language...) 

### Salem
I like the idea of this app, but you should look into some additional features to expand the scope of the project slightly, or at least provide more details on this algorithm. Ignoring the algorithm, this app reads a bit like Grumblr, but with Github code snippets for posts. It's definitely feseable to turn this into a full-fledged project, but I'd consider adding something like notifications of new comments, or perhaps the ability to track comments per line of code.
