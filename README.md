CodeBook is an all-inclusive, go-to source for anyone looking to learn a new programming language. 

As one of the most effective ways to pick up a new language is to view and work through existing examples, we aim to create a Web Application that will bring together a collection of open-source code (found on GitHub) into one place, based on a userâ€™s preferred language and level of experience. The goal is not to provide a specific tutorial but rather to see what code looks like in real life.

The deployment branch contains the version of our code that we run on our deployment version. We only just pushed to master so the stats would look nice. The master branch is not deployable.
