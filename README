CodeBook is an all-inclusive, go-to source for anyone looking to learn a new programming language. 

As one of the most effective ways to pick up a new language is to view and work through existing examples, we aim to create a Web Application that will bring together a collection of open-source code (found on GitHub) into one place, based on a userâ€™s preferred language and level of experience. The goal is not to provide a specific tutorial but rather to see what code looks like in real life.
